## üìñ Overview

- **Agent Laboratory** is an end-to-end autonomous research workflow meant to assist **you** as the human researcher toward **implementing your research ideas**. Agent Laboratory consists of specialized agents driven by large language models to support you through the entire research workflow‚Äîfrom conducting literature reviews and formulating plans to executing experiments and writing comprehensive reports. 
- This system is not designed to replace your creativity but to complement it, enabling you to focus on ideation and critical thinking while automating repetitive and time-intensive tasks like coding and documentation. By accommodating varying levels of computational resources and human involvement, Agent Laboratory aims to accelerate scientific discovery and optimize your research productivity.

### üî¨ How does Agent Laboratory work?

- Agent Laboratory consists of three primary phases that systematically guide the research process: (1) Literature Review, (2) Experimentation, and (3) Report Writing. During each phase, specialized agents driven by LLMs collaborate to accomplish distinct objectives, integrating external tools like arXiv, Hugging Face, Python, and LaTeX to optimize outcomes. This structured workflow begins with the independent collection and analysis of relevant research papers, progresses through collaborative planning and data preparation, and results in automated experimentation and comprehensive report generation. Details on specific agent roles and their contributions across these phases are discussed in the paper.

5. **Install pdflatex [OPTIONAL]**

    ## Instructions for Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install pdflatex
    ```
    
    If you find the package is not available, 
    you can install it via the following commands:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base
    
    sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended
    sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra
    
    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
    sudo apt-get install texlive-science
    ```
    
    ## Instructions for Windows Users

    To have a TeX engine on Windows, you need to install the MikTeX software. Follow these steps:

    1. Go to the [MikTeX download page](https://miktex.org/download).
    2. Download the installer for your version of Windows.
    3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
    4. Once installed, you can verify the installation by opening a command prompt and typing `latex --version`.
    
    - This enables latex source to be compiled by the agents.
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If this step cannot be run due to not having sudo access, 
pdf compiling can be turned off via running Agent Laboratory

## Tips for better research outcomes


#### [Tip #1] üìù Make sure to write extensive notes! üìù

**Writing extensive notes is important** for helping your agent understand what you're looking to accomplish in your project, 
as well as any style preferences. Notes can include any experiments you want the agents to perform, providing API keys, certain plots or figures you want included, or anything you want the agent to know when performing research.

This is also your opportunity to let the agent know **what compute resources it has access to**, 
e.g. GPUs (how many, what type of GPU, how many GBs), CPUs (how many cores, what type of CPUs), storage limitations, and hardware specs.

In order to add notes, you must modify the TASK_NOTE_LLM structure inside of `config.py`. 
Provided below is an example set of notes used for some of our experiments. 


```
TASK_NOTE_LLM = [
    {"phases": ["plan formulation"],
     "note": f"You should come up with a plan for TWO experiments."},

    {"phases": ["plan formulation", "data preparation", "running experiments"],
     "note": "Please use gpt-4o-mini for your experiments."},

    {"phases": ["running experiments"],
     "note": 'Use the following code to inference gpt-4o-mini: \nfrom openai import OpenAI\nos.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "{{api_key}}"\nclient = OpenAI()\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\nmodel="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", messages=messages)\nanswer = completion.choices[0].message.content\n'},

    {"phases": ["running experiments"],
     "note": "You have access to only gpt-4o-mini using the OpenAI API, please use the following key {{api_key}} but do not use too many inferences. Do not use openai.ChatCompletion.create or any openai==0.28 commands. Instead use the provided inference code."},

    {"phases": ["running experiments"],
     "note": "I would recommend using a small dataset (approximately only 100 data points) to run experiments in order to save time. Do not use much more than this unless you have to or are running the final tests."},

    {"phases": ["data preparation", "running experiments"],
     "note": "You are running on a Ubuntu System. You can use 'cuda' with PyTorch"},

    {"phases": ["data preparation", "running experiments"],
     "note": "Generate figures with very colorful and artistic design."},

    {"phases": ["literature review", "plan formulation",
                "data preparation", "running experiments",
                "results interpretation", "report writing",
                "report refinement"],
     "note": "You should always write in the following language to converse and to write the report {{language}}"}
]
```

#### [Tip #2] üöÄ Using more powerful models generally leads to better research üöÄ

When conducting research, **the choice of model can significantly impact the quality of results**. More powerful models tend to have higher accuracy, better reasoning capabilities, and better report generation. If computational resources allow, prioritize the use of advanced models such as o1-(mini/preview) or similar state-of-the-art large language models.

However, **it‚Äôs important to balance performance and cost-effectiveness**. While powerful models may yield better results, they are often more expensive and time-consuming to run. Consider using them selectively‚Äîfor instance, for key experiments or final analyses‚Äîwhile relying on smaller, more efficient models for iterative tasks or initial prototyping.

When resources are limited, **optimize by fine-tuning smaller models** on your specific dataset or combining pre-trained models with task-specific prompts to achieve the desired balance between performance and computational efficiency.

-----

#### [Tip #3] ‚úÖ You can load previous saves from checkpoints ‚úÖ

**If you lose progress, internet connection, or if a subtask fails, you can always load from a previous state.** 
All of your progress is saved by default in the `state_saves` variable, which stores each individual checkpoint. 

##### **For Web Interface**

You can check out the `Resume Previous Research` section to load from a previous state.
By checking the `Load Existing Research State` flag and then select the stage you want to load from, you can easily load from a previous state.
If the state is not up-to-date, you can always click the `Refresh Saved States` button to refresh the saved states.

##### **For CLI**

Just pass the following arguments when running `ai_lab_repo.py`

```bash
python ai_lab_repo.py --api-key "API_KEY_HERE" --research-topic "YOUR RESEARCH IDEA" --llm-backend "o1-mini" --load-existing True --load-existing-path "state_saves/LOAD_PATH"
```

-----



#### [Tip #4] üàØ If you are running in a language other than English üà≤

If you are running Agent Laboratory in a language other than English, no problem, just make sure to provide a language flag to the agents to perform research in your preferred language. Note that we have not extensively studied running Agent Laboratory in other languages, so be sure to report any problems you encounter.

##### **For Web Interface**
You can select the language in the dropdown menu. If the language you want is not available, you can edit the `config_gradio.py` file to add the language you want.

##### **For CLI**
If you are running in Chinese, you can run the following command:
`python ai_lab_repo.py --api-key "API_KEY_HERE" --research-topic "YOUR RESEARCH IDEA (in your language)" --llm-backend "o1-mini" --language "‰∏≠Êñá"`
