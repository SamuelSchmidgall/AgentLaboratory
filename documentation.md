   - PaperSolver generates initial paper scaffolding
   - Paper sections are constructed one by one:
     - Abstract
     - Introduction
     - Background/Related Work
     - Methods
     - Experimental Setup
     - Results
     - Discussion
   - LaTeX document is iteratively improved
   - Figures and tables are incorporated
   - LaTeX is compiled to PDF (if enabled)
3. **Output**: Complete research report in LaTeX format and PDF (if compilation enabled)

**Event Sequence**:
```

ReportWritingPhaseCompleted
```

**User Interaction** (Co-pilot Mode):
- After the report is finalized, the user is presented with the LaTeX and/or PDF
- User can approve the report or provide feedback for improvements
- If feedback is provided, the PaperSolver will incorporate it and restart the phase

**Artifacts Produced**:
- Complete LaTeX document
- PDF report (if LaTeX compilation is enabled)
- README.md generated by ProfessorAgent

**Transition**:
Upon completion, the workflow progresses to the Report Refinement phase, passing the report as context.

#### Phase 7: Report Refinement

**Purpose**: Evaluate and potentially improve the research report based on reviewer feedback.

**Agents Involved**:
- Primary: ReviewersAgent
- Secondary: PhDStudentAgent

**Data Flow**:
1. **Input**: Research report from Phase 6
2. **Process**:
   - ReviewersAgent generates reviews from multiple reviewer perspectives
   - PhDStudentAgent evaluates the reviews and decides whether to accept or revise
   - If revision is needed, the workflow returns to an earlier phase
3. **Output**: Final research report or decision to iterate

**Event Sequence**:
```
ReportWritingPhaseCompleted â†’
  ReviewersAgentActivated â†’
    MultipleReviewsGenerated â†’
    ReviewsAnalyzed â†’
  PhDStudentAgentActivated â†’
    RevisionDecisionMade â†’
    UserApprovalRequested (if in co-pilot mode) â†’
  [If revision needed, return to appropriate previous phase] â†’
ReportRefinementPhaseCompleted
```

**User Interaction** (Co-pilot Mode):
- After reviews are generated, the user is presented with the reviews
- User decides whether to accept the report or request revisions
- If revisions are requested, the user helps determine which phase to return to

**Artifacts Produced**:
- Reviewer feedback
- Final research artifacts:
  - LaTeX report
  - PDF report (if LaTeX compilation is enabled)
  - README.md
  - Source code
  - Experimental results

**Transition**:
Upon completion, the entire research workflow is finalized, and all artifacts are available in the `research_dir` directory.

### Tips for Effective Use

#### Writing Effective Notes

One of the most important ways to guide Agent Laboratory is through detailed notes. These notes can be added to the `task_notes_LLM` structure in `ai_lab_repo.py`:

```python
task_notes_LLM = [
    {"phases": ["plan formulation"],
     "note": "You should come up with a plan for TWO experiments."},
     
    {"phases": ["data preparation", "running experiments"],
     "note": "You are running on a MacBook laptop. You can use 'mps' with PyTorch"},
     
    {"phases": ["data preparation", "running experiments"],
     "note": "Generate figures with very colorful and artistic design."},
]
```

Effective notes should include:
- Compute resource information (GPUs, CPUs, storage limitations)
- Specific experiments to be performed
- Style preferences for visualizations
- API keys or access credentials (if needed)
- Size constraints or performance considerations

#### Choosing Appropriate Models

The choice of LLM model significantly impacts the quality of research outputs:

- More powerful models (o1, o1-preview) generally produce higher quality results but at higher cost
- For initial prototyping or exploration, consider using o1-mini or gpt-4o
- For final results or complex research tasks, consider using more capable models

A balanced approach is to use more efficient models for iterative phases and reserve powerful models for critical phases like plan formulation and report writing.

#### Handling Large Research Projects

For complex research projects:

1. **Break down into sub-topics**: Focus on one aspect at a time
2. **Increase literature review limits**: Use `--num-papers-lit-review` to include more papers
3. **Extend solver steps**: Increase `--mlesolver-max-steps` and `--papersolver-max-steps`
4. **Use checkpoints strategically**: Save after major phases and iterate as needed
5. **Leverage co-pilot mode**: Provide guidance at critical decision points

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **API Errors**:
   - **Issue**: "No API key provided" or authentication errors
   - **Solution**: Check that your API keys are correctly set and have sufficient credits

2. **LaTeX Compilation Errors**:
   - **Issue**: "Compilation failed" or missing PDF output
   - **Solution**: Run with `--compile-latex "false"` or install pdflatex

3. **Memory or Resource Limitations**:
   - **Issue**: Slow performance or crashes during experimentation
   - **Solution**: Add notes to limit dataset size or model complexity

4. **Agent Getting Stuck**:
   - **Issue**: Agent repeating the same actions or not progressing
   - **Solution**: Use co-pilot mode to intervene, or restart from the last checkpoint

5. **Low-Quality Results**:
   - **Issue**: Experiments or reports don't meet expectations
   - **Solution**: Try using a more capable LLM model or provide more detailed notes

#### Getting Help
